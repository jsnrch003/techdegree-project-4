# Techdegree Project 4 -- Web Style Guide

In this project, Team Treehouse provided completed index.html and styles.css files. I was responsible for converting the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I also looked for repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS and stored them in Sass variables.
